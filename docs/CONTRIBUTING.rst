Contributing to django-threaded-multihost
-----------------------------------------

We are pleased to accept contributions and bugfixes for django-threaded-multihost.

To make a contribution:

1. First fork the project from bitbucket.

2. Build and test your addon or update.  You **must** provide tests for us to accept your contribution, and these tests *should* be unit tests rather than doctests.  However, doctests in models are acceptible.  If you are fixing a bug, it is a good rule of thumb to provide a test which provides a regression-test against that bug.

3. If this is a simple patch, go to `django-threaded-multihost on bitbucket`_ and enter a bug with the patch.

4. If this is a larger patch or a new feature, make a branch and propose its merger:

   - Make a fork on bitbucket for your addition
   - Make your changes to the fork
   - Issue a pull request when it is ready for inclusion into tip.
